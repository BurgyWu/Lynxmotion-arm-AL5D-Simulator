# Lynxmotion-arm-AL5D-Simulator

Task A
1) Derive a DH representation of forward kinematics for the Lynxmotion arm2
. Use MATLAB, lecture
material and further reading. Include all your investigations and report this.
2) Analyse the workspace of the robotâ€™s end-effector when each preceding joints move through
their range of motion and plot all 2D and 3D views of the workspace.
3) Derive the inverse kinematics model for the manipulator (analytical solution).

Task B
1) Plan a task3 and test your forward kinematics model in MATLAB for at least 5 positions, plot the
robot and show your investigations. This process should give you at least 5 sets of Cartesian
coordinates specifying the end-effector position and orientation in 3D space.
2) Solve the Inverse Kinematics for these positions in 3D space and obtain sets of Joint Coordinates.
Create an appropriate plot/animation in MATLAB for the motion of the robot.
3) Implement 3 different trajectories between the Cartesian Points identified above and create an
appropriate plot to demonstrate them:
a. Implement a free motion between the points
b. Implement a straight line trajectory between the points
c. Set an obstacle between any two points (e.g. a cylinder between point 3 and 4) and
implement an object avoidance trajectory.
Task C
Use screw theory to claculate the Inverse Kinematics of the arm again
